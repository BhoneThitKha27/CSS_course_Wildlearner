# WildLearner CSS Course Practice

This repo contains my personal practice files based on the [WildLearner CSS Course](https://wildlearner.com/learn/course/css).  
I followed the course step-by-step and applied each concept in small, focused HTML+CSS examples.

## What's Inside

Each file covers one concept from the course using only what was taught there.

- External CSS files linked to each HTML file
- Simple layouts and styling based on course lessons
- No extras, no overcomplications â€” just the basics done right

## Why This Repo Exists

This is just a part of my learning journey.  
I made this to track my progress and maybe help others starting out too.  
It's not perfect, but it's real.

## Credits

Made with help from ChatGPT (my AI buddy) who kept me going when my brain said no.  
Big thanks to WildLearner for the solid intro.
